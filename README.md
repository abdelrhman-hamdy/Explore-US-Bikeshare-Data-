# "WeRateDogs" 
if you love dogs, surely you heard about “WeRateDogs”. WeRateDogs is one of famous pages on
twitter that rates people’s dogs with funny comments , the dominator rate is 10, but the nominator is
alwayas greater than 10 ,why? Becaue “they’re good dogs Brent”.

In This project I've gathered data about the page's tweets with 3 different formats (.csv,.tsv,.txt) , assessed the data, found 19 quality issues and 3 tidiness assues, cleaned it, and finally  used the cleaned data to analyse and visualize the page,and the dogs tweeted on. you will find 2 PDFs, one for wrangling efforts, and the other for the insights and visualization obtained from the cleaned data . 

i did the project using Python programming language.
for gathering i used Tweepy, Requests, and Json libraies.
in Aseessing and cleanning i used Pandas.
in Visualization i used matplotlib.pyplot and Pandas libraries
